This repostoy is for master thesis with title "A Comparative Analysis of European City Police Presence on Twitter"

## Abstract
---
This study comprehensively analyses 21 Twitter accounts from city police departments across 16 European cities. It examined various communication practices exhibited by city police Twitter accounts, including post frequency and timing, retweet tendencies, resource-sharing strategies, language use, and hashtag employment. The research also investigated city police-related tweets from citizens in April and May 2023, providing a comparative perspective on topic preferences between police departments and citizens. Although common characteristics emerged among police accounts, each city displayed specific focal topics. Generally, the areas of concern for both citizens and police overlapped, but they emphasized different events and perspectives.
